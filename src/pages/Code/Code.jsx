The system functions similarly to a looper station or a looper pedal, allowing users to record multiple layers of sound that will generate superimposed visual patterns. The aesthetics is inspired by Kaleidosync and the works of various audio-visual artists, including Antoine Schmitt and Ryoji Ikeda, and it will explore alternative representations of sound.",

One aspect I noticed and always thought was interesting was that geese would often be in very large groups or hordes which can further intimidate people. However, it can also reflect and signify the community and bond that they have with each other. For instance, when a flock of geese fly, they fly in a V formation, which helps them conserve energy and allows them to fly longer distances than if they were alone. In addition, if a goose is sick or injured, two other geese will follow it to help and protect it, either until it dies or is well enough to join the flock again. They have such a great sense of community and are often seen in large groups. I really wanted to encapsulate this idea of community and being with others through this project.",

From there, I initially created a sketch.js file that drew the goose out on a plane and had a walking animation when the user pressed certain buttons or touched certain areas. After this, I began setting up the server that I wanted to host my project on. Once the server had all the basics, I began incorporating the 3D models and code from my initial sketch.js file into the sketchy.js file in the public --> client folder. The code begins by setting up a server. Every time someone new joins the server, socket.io assigns new parameter values to the particular client and broadcasts this information to all online users. The draw function then creates a new goose drawing for each client online. If the user moves by pressing specific keys or touching specific areas on the screen, their information or data gets updated. They will see their input in response as a walking animation. In addition, these changes that were made to particular paramters are also sent to the server. The server receives this data and broadcasts the particular changes to all the connected clients that that particular player moved. This allows all the user inputs to be shown visibly across all screens. Finally, when a user disconnects, the particular player will be deleted from the list of online players and be cleared from the display."

Creating this code, I did a lot of brute forcing and set very specific parameters. However, one interesting way I decided to create the animation was setting up the legs a particular way. With the legs, I used push() and pop() functions so taht the particular translations I was using would not affect other aspects later on. I also decided to 'connect' all three limbs of the leg, topLeg, botLeg, and foot. This made it much easier to control translations with the limbs together. This is because I wanted to best imitate 'rigging' animations and prevent really awkward motions between these particular joints and components. By connecting all these ligaments to each other and referencing their positions, it made it a lot easier to animate and move the components.",
            "Another key aspect was figuring out how to identify which goose to move, replicate it on other clients, while keeping the camera focused on the client's goose. To try and solve this, I created a for loop within the draw function that would 'draw' a new goose for every online user. Outside of the loop, I would identify whether the user that moved was the user on that client, using socket.id. If it was, then their translation would be updated, as well as their camera. After updating their location, I would emit these new data points (x, y) to the server. The server would receive them, update the coordinates of the particular client with specified id, then broadcast it out to all other online clients."

Next we have the personally designed and animated koi fish, produced with Adobe Illustrator and After Effects, which move with a particular pattern. However, they also have a factor of randomness, randomizing their colour animation and angle of trajectory. Likewise, we also have lily pads, which are randomly assigned flowers and slowly move across the screen and rotate with a random speed. This was to help mimic lily pads floating on water. Next, we have the randomized ripples appearing on the surface of the water to create more movement within the piece.
